# Tic Tac Toe Game with Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains a Tic Tac Toe game with artificial intelligence, programmed in JavaScript using the Minimax algorithm.

## Description

The game consists of a 3x3 board on which two players, X and O, take turns placing their tokens on the board. The player who places three tokens in a line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins the game.
